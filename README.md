"Teapot Tool" is a very simple Installer / Repair and configuration mananger. 
This tool grabs the latest download contents from our webserver, so it is automatically always up to date.
This uses **ilmerge** to pack everything into a single executable "Teapot-Tool.exe" (This may cause false AV flags)

I will add the latest compiled executable to the repo (Last Built: 04/10/2025)

**Permanent Download:** https://TeapotLive.net/Installer

**How to Use:**
#1 Make sure your console is added to neighborhood and connected
#2 Run Teapot-Tool.exe and click "Install to Device"

**Teapot is installed but not working?**
Try using the "Repair Install" option, to cleanly refresh all your files. 

**Auto Teapot Config Updater:**
Teapot-Tool will automatically update your device with the latest up to date Teapot.ini configuration file.
